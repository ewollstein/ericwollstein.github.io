			Sentinels of the Multiverse is a comic book themed cooperative card game for 3-5 players. 
			The players take on the roles of <a href="glossary.html#hero">heroes</a>, each with a 
			different theme & deck of cards to reflect that. The heroes conduct battle with a 
			<a href="glossary.html#villain">supervillain</a> which takes place in an 
			<a href="glossary.html#enviro">environments</a>, with their own decks as well. Players 
			must coordinate attacks and find combinations of their powers to adapt to various situations 
			as the game progresses. These differences in strengths & weaknesses between all the decks 
			is the goal we wish to achieve on this site.

			Here's a video from the fine people at <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/102652/sentinels-multiverse">
			Board Game Geek</a> playing Sentinels for the first time. This should give you a pretty good idea of how gameplay 
			works, though in explaining the rules they mention being able to draw two cards at the end of the turn if you 
			don't use a power, but to draw the extra card you have to skip both playing a card and using a power.
